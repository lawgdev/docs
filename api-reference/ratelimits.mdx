Rate limits are dependent on your plan and are subject to change. If you need a higher rate limit, please contact us at support@lawg.dev or join our Discord.

## Basic

Some routes have different rate limits than others. Namely `POST log` and `POST event`, they have a higher rate limit than the rest of the routes, to allow for more logging.

Here is a table of the rate limits:
| Tier | Rate Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 100 requests per minute |
| Pro | 1,000 requests per minute |
| Startup | 5,000 requests per minute |
| Enterprise | 10,000 requests per minute |

## Example response

Generally, the response will look like this:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "You are being rate limited."
  }
}
```
