Theres two main ways to authenticate with lawg's API, through API tokens and sessions tokens.

## Basic

Session tokens are tokens that are generated upon logging in and signing up. These are generally only used for frontend purposes, and they will show up in the "Devices" tab of your user settings.

## API Tokens

API tokens are tokens that are generated for API usage. These are generally used for backend purposes, and they will show up in the "Tokens" tab of your user settings. You can create as many API tokens as you want, and you can delete them at any time.

## Usage

To use your token, you will need to provide the "Authorization" header with the value of "Bearer" and your token. For example:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer lawg_xxxxxxxx'
```
