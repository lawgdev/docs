When lawg returns errors, we do it in a specific schema to help the end developer interacting with the API have a guessable and easy to understand error.

## Schema

Typically, an error will look like this

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "code",
    "message": "message"
  }
}
```

## Codes

Here is a list of all the error codes that lawg can return.

| Code                    | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `rate_limit_exceeded`   | You are being rate limited.                           |
| `conflict`              | The resource you are trying to create already exists. |
| `not_found`             | The resource you are trying to access does not exist. |
| `bad_request`           | The request you sent was malformed.                   |
| `unauthorized`          | The request you sent was unauthorized.                |
