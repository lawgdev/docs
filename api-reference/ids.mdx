---

Under the hood, lawg uses [pika-id](https://github.com/hopinc/pika-id) to generate ID's.

They look like this

```bash
prefix_xxxxxxxx
```

and secure ID's look like this

```bash
prefix_s_xxxxxx
```

You can find more information about Pika IDs and how you can decode them to gain information about the ID [here](https://github.com/hopinc/pika-id)

You can define lawg ID's like this

```ts
type PikaIds =
  | "user"
  | "project"
  | "feed"
  | "event"
  | "lawg"
  | "device"
  | "session"
  | "pm" // project member, used internally
  | "log"
  | "comment"
  | "activity";

type Id<T extends PikaIds> = `${T}_${string}`;
```
