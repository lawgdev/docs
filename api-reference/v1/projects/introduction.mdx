## Schema

Here is what a project will look like

```typescript
{
  id: "project_xxxx";
  namespace: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string | null;
  tier: number;
  stripe_id?: string | null;
  feeds: {
    id: "feed_xxxx";
    project_id: "project_xxxx";
    name: string;
    description: string | null;
    emoji: string | null;
    type: FeedType;
    order: number;
    muted: boolean;
  }[];
  members: {
    id: "user_xxxxx";
    username: string;
    icon: string | null;
    email: string;
  }[];
};

enum ProjectTier {
  FREE,
  PRO,
  SCALE,
  ENTERPRISE,
}
```

## Namespaces

Namespaces on projects are unique identifiers for a project. They are used in the URL for the project, and are used in the API to identify a project.

Instead of referencing a project's ID which isn't very URL friendly in terms of length, you can refernece the namespace.

## Project Tiers

Project tiers are identified as a number from an enum. The enum is as follows:

```typescript
enum ProjectTier {
  FREE, // 0
  PRO, // 1
  SCALE, // 2
  ENTERPRISE, // 3
}
```
