lawg.py is a Python library used for interacting with lawg's API to create events, application logs, and insights.
Both async and sync versions of the library are available.

## Requirements

lawg.py requires Python 3.7 or higher and is operating system agnostic.

## Installation

lawg.py can be found on PyPI and installed with pip.

```sh
pip install lawg
```

Add the `-U` flag to upgrade an existing installation.

```sh
pip install -U lawg
```

If you're planning to contribute to lawg.py, the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) package manager is used internally.
you can install the development dependencies from the cloned repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lawgdev/lawg.py.git
cd lawg.py
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

after importing lawg.py,
`lawg.Client`, `lawg.AsyncClient`, and `lawg.Handler`
are available for immediate use.

for demonstration purposes, assume the following variables are valid constant strings.

```python
import os
API_TOKEN = os.getenv("LAWG_API_TOKEN")
PROJECT = os.getenv("LAWG_PROJECT")
FEED = os.getenv("LAWG_FEED")
```

to create an event, use the `lawg.Client.event` method.

```python
import lawg
client = lawg.Client(token=API_TOKEN, project=PROJECT)
client.event(
    feed=FEED,
    title="User Signed Up",
    description="A new user has signed up for the service!",  # optional
    emoji="ðŸŽ‰",  # optional
)

```

if the feed will remain the same across multiple events,
a feed object can be created.

```py
import lawg

client = lawg.Client(token=API_TOKEN, project=PROJECT)
feed = client.feed(FEED)

feed.event(
    title="User Signed Up",
    description="A new user has signed up for the service!",  # optional
    emoji="ðŸŽ‰",  # optional
)
```

A similar process can be used to create an insight.

```py
import lawg

client = lawg.Client(token=API_TOKEN, project=PROJECT)
client.insight(
    title="User Count",
    description="The number of users on the service.",
    emoji="ðŸ‘¥",
    value=1,
)
```
